                    <p> <br />We started using BEAMS approximately 12 years ago after several months looking at different packages and instantly found BEAMS easy to pick up & learn. The set out is very well organised in the way it follows a path very similar to how you would estimate, then contract and administer a project, our accountant has also stated it is one of the best building software packages that he has seen in regards to accounts side of things. One aspect I have been most impressed with is the backup service we receive while BEAMS is based in Perth the help provided is excellent a credit to Peter and Lynda Fonte. I would have no hesitation in recommending BEAMS to another builder.

                    <p> <br />We have used BEAMS for over 15 years, since the introduction of GST in 2000. The system is very user friendly, however technical support is readily available if required. BEAMS assists us with the management and accounting of multiple building projects as well as payroll for our staff, trades and suppliers. We are happy to recommend BEAMS.

                        My company Base Plumbing has been using BEAMS for 9 years.  After using BEAMS for only a short period I discovered it to be an extremely user friendly database application that has assisted the company to implement more efficient turn around times, which has enabled the company to save time and costs.

                        The database that BEAMS designed for my company is plumbing based rather that building based, proving its flexibility. Due to this I found the BEAMS support team was very helpful in setting up our database.  Training is always available along with the online & telephone support team.
                        I truly believe that BEAMS can be adapted to suit any businesses.  I therefore have no hesitation in recommending BEAMS to any other business owner who is looking to introduce more efficient turn around times thus saving the company money.

                <p><br /><br />We have been with BEAMS now for the past 15 years, we can’t express how helpful the program has been over those years, at one stage we were so busy that we really don’t know what we would have done without the BEAMS support staff.  Right from contracts, the claiming of progress claims, the itemising of materials & Business Activity Statements everything is done for you. I myself had never used a computer until using BEAMS in 2000 & it was a breeze.

                    <br />BEAMS has been the backbone of Home design building group for over twelve years.  Our company simply could not function without the BEAMS system.  The accuracy, documentation, on site communication, accounting and data transfer are all critical to our business.  The support service and flexibility over the years has been exceptional and the constant improvements and upgrades keeps our company at the forefront.

                    When I first started my Building Company in 1999 my estimates and purchase orders were hand written, on my first ever building contract I had no idea how I was going to keep track of accounts, progress claims and job tracking. That is when I realised that I required an integrated computer program that could help me run my business to reflect the current times.
                        The crew at BEAMS helped me with the setup of the program and gave me ongoing support to make the transition into BEAMS as easy as it could be. When the GST came into effect they virtually rewrote the accounts module of the program & came into my office and unloaded all my data and reloaded it with the new GST program at no extra cost.
                        Having an extensive building background they understand your concerns and how to direct with most problems as they have encountered it themselves. BEAMS helps my business look professional with well set out Purchase Order and invoice formats including company logo which helps us run professionally in the office saving us time and money.
                    <br /><br />
                        I would recommend BEAMS to any Builder who wants to run a successful business with a program that works.
