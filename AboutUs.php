                    <p>BEAMS was developed 30 years ago by a builder who after using a product that was available at the time realised the need for an integrated building package, BEAMS was released to the general market 5 years later. Based in Western Australia BEAMS now has users nationwide including top 100 builders, husband and wife teams and sub-contractors. BEAMS is still the only software option on the market today to include every stage of the building process in one package, from web leads in CRM, estimating with CADIMage, scheduling and accounts, plus the addition of mobile functionality. The experienced and dedicated team at BEAMS are constantly looking for ways to improve the package which is in perpetual development as the market changes and our usersâ€™ needs evolve.</p>                    
                    <p>BEAMS is 100% Australian owned and operated and is licensed to carry the Australian Made logo.<br/>
